# yomo-source

## What is yomo-source? What can it do?

`yomo-source` provides the data source for YoMo Ecosystem.

Massive real-time data generated by IoT devices, intelligent devices, etc, you can use [Y3 Codec](https://github.com/yomorun/y3-codec-golang) to `encode` the data, and use `QUIC transport`, then the data source can be used as a `yomo-source` to connect YoMo Ecosystem and enjoy the perfect low-latency streaming computing experience brought by YoMo.

## How to write yomo-source?

- Encode data via [Y3 Codec](https://github.com/yomorun/y3-codec). [Y3](https://github.com/yomorun/y3-codec-golang) provides Golang SDK, and `Y3` will provide other languages' SDK soon, help users use high-performance codec to transfer data easily, you only need to use `Y3` SDK to `encode` data.
- Transfer data over `QUIC`. [YoMo](https://github.com/yomorun/yomo) provides `QUIC` Golang SDK, just a few lines of code can transfer data to YoMo safely and efficiently over `QUIC`. If you are using other programming language, you can find the open-source `QUIC` implementations in [quicwg](https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/wiki/Implementations).

Congratulations! You only need to complete the above two steps, then you can connect the existing data source to the YoMo Ecosystem as a `yomo-source`.

### Examples

#### yomo-source-example

[yomo-source-example](https://github.com/yomorun/yomo-source-example) provides an example of generate mocking data and connect to YoMo over `QUIC`. You can refer to this example to implement your `yomo-source`.

#### yomo-source-mqtt-broker-starter

[yomo-source-mqtt-broker-starter](https://github.com/yomorun/yomo-source-mqtt-broker-starter) provides an example of receive `MQTT` messages and connect to YoMo over `QUIC`. If you are using IoT devices based on the `MQTT` protocol, you can refer to this example to connect the MQTT messages as a `yomo-source`.

YoMo will provide more examples of IoT protocols and SDKs, then you can connect data to YoMo Ecosystem easily.
